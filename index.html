			<h1>History of Mobile Library</h1>
			<p>
				A first bookmobile in the world was horse-drawn and operated in 1857 in Cumbria county in North West England. It was aimed to increase the lending of its books to enthusiastic local patrons.
Since that time the beautiful pictures of libraries on wheels populated our minds and memories. We associate them with passionate librarians, who, in many cases, came as a rescue to people who were eager to learn more and get smarter.
Wait, don`t get too nostalgic. Vehicles that offer access to books are definitely not something from the past. Just the opposite. The internet won`t kill the excitement when you see the books are coming to your neighborhood.
The vehicles listed in this article are not always bookmobiles in the strict sense. Sometimes they are mobile libraries you can check out books at. Sometimes they are book fairs or bookshops. And, eventually, you`ll find here vehicles that offer books at no charge.
No matter where and how they travel, these book vehicles have three things in common: passion, creativity, and determination of men who originate and operate them.

			<h1>Rural Mobile Library</h1>
			<p>
				A healthy reading habit can transform a person and access to books and reading material relevant to the target group can transform a community. DLF Mobile Rural Libraries is our endeavor to overcome the lack of access to schools or libraries, especially in the rural areas. We reach the reading material the people need to their doorsteps. We believe if India is to progress, every constituent, every citizen must have the opportunity to keep themselves well informed.
		Through these Rural Mobile Libraries rural folks are keeping themselves abreast of latest news, happenings around the world, information`s regarding modern agricultural techniques and government programmes which directly benefit them. Our Rural Mobile Libraries cater to all age groups and the initiative has received a very encouraging response. The adults have taken to reading with great enthusiasm while adolescents and children too have shown encouraging participation.
